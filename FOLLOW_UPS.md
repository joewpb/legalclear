# Follow-ups

- S1-3: upsert-by-email in `attorney_referral.py:upsert_user` still overwrites an
  existing profile found by client-supplied `email` with no verification (e.g. email
  ownership confirmation). Out of scope for this fix per DECISIONS.md; needs a
  verification step (e.g. magic link) before it can upsert by email.
- S1-3: `/api/attorney-referral/intake` and `/submit` are also named in-scope by the
  audit but were NOT gated with `require_api_key` in this fix — the shipped frontend
  caller (`AttorneyReferralFL.tsx`) calls them with raw `fetch()` and no `X-API-Key`
  header, so adding the dependency would 401 the live chat/submit flow. Fixing this
  requires a coordinated frontend change (send the key, or switch to the `api.js`
  axios client) — reported instead of coded per scope rules.

## S1-3b (new triage item)

Finding verbatim (from item 4 run): "/api/attorney-referral/intake and /submit are also
named in-scope by the audit but were NOT gated with require_api_key in this fix — the
shipped frontend caller (AttorneyReferralFL.tsx) calls them with raw fetch() and no
X-API-Key header, so adding the dependency would 401 the live chat/submit flow. Fixing
this requires a coordinated frontend change (send the key, or switch to the api.js axios
client)."

Dependency: S1-3b must not be scheduled until S1-5 (PII/DeepSeek) is decided — it
touches the same intake path.
